# Real-Time Debugging Guide

## Quick Test Procedure

### Step 1: Test Participant Persistence
1. Create a new session
2. Note your nickname in the header: "You are: YourName"
3. **Refresh the page (F5)**
4. Check if nickname is the same
5. Open console (F12) - you should see:
   ```
   📋 Session loaded, checking participant status...
   ✅ Restored participant from localStorage: YourName
   ```

### Step 2: Test Real-Time Updates
1. Copy the session URL
2. Open it in **another browser** (or incognito window)
3. Join with a different name
4. In the **first browser**, open console (F12)
5. You should see:
   ```
   ✅ Session updated via real-time: {...}
   ```
6. The new participant should appear in the list **immediately**

## If It's NOT Working

### Console Messages to Look For

#### Good Signs ✅
```
Subscribing to real-time updates for session: xxx
Realtime subscription status: SUBSCRIBED
✅ Successfully subscribed to real-time updates
📋 Session loaded, checking participant status...
✅ Restored participant from localStorage: YourName
```

#### Bad Signs ❌
```
CHANNEL_ERROR → Realtime NOT enabled in Supabase
TIMED_OUT → Network/connection issue
❌ Failed to join session → API error
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Subscription works but NO realtime events (MOST COMMON)
**Symptom**:
- Console shows "SUBSCRIBED" ✅
- Console shows "Waiting for UPDATE events..."
- **BUT** when you vote/reveal, you see NO "🎉 REALTIME EVENT RECEIVED" message
- After 10 seconds: "⏰ Starting polling fallback"

**This means**: Realtime is enabled but UPDATE events aren't being broadcast.

**Fix - Option 1: Configure Supabase Realtime Publication**:

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**:
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ijruhconijiksnayqlew
   - Click **SQL Editor** → **New Query**

2. **Run this SQL** to check publication:
   ```sql
   -- Check if realtime publication includes sessions table
   SELECT schemaname, tablename
   FROM pg_publication_tables
   WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';
   ```

3. **If `sessions` is NOT in the list**, run:
   ```sql
   -- Add sessions table to realtime publication
   ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE sessions;
   ```

4. **Verify it worked**:
   ```sql
   -- Should now show sessions table
   SELECT schemaname, tablename
   FROM pg_publication_tables
   WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';
   ```

5. **Hard refresh your browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)

6. **Test**: Click reveal/vote - you should now see:
   ```
   🎉 REALTIME EVENT RECEIVED: {event: "UPDATE", ...}
   ```

**Fix - Option 2: Use Polling Mode** (Automatic Fallback):
- The app now automatically switches to polling after 10 seconds
- You'll see "⏰ Starting polling fallback (every 2 seconds)"
- This works but is less efficient than realtime
- UI will update every 2 seconds instead of instantly

### Issue 2: "CHANNEL_ERROR" in console
**Cause**: Supabase Realtime is not enabled

**Fix**:
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ijruhconijiksnayqlew
2. Click **Database** → **Replication**
3. Find the `sessions` table in the list
4. **Toggle the switch ON** (it should turn green/blue)
5. Refresh your browser

### Issue 2: Participant name changes on refresh
**Symptom**: Every refresh creates a new participant

**Debugging**:
1. Open console (F12)
2. Refresh the page
3. Look for one of these:
   - ✅ `"Restored participant from localStorage: YourName"` → **WORKING**
   - 🚪 `"Joining session..."` → **NOT WORKING**

**Possible causes**:
- localStorage is disabled/cleared
- Session expired (24 hours)
- Participant was removed from session manually

**Fix**:
1. Check localStorage:
   - DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Look for `scrumpoker_participant`
   - Should contain: `{"participantId":"...","nickname":"...","sessionId":"..."}`

2. If empty, that's your problem. Create a new session to test.

### Issue 3: New participants don't appear
**Symptom**: Second browser joins, but first browser doesn't update

**Debugging in FIRST browser**:
1. Open console
2. Second browser joins
3. Look for: `"✅ Session updated via real-time"`
   - **If YES**: UI issue (unlikely)
   - **If NO**: Realtime not working

**Fix**:
1. **Check Realtime is enabled** (see Issue 1)
2. Check console for subscription status:
   ```
   Realtime subscription status: SUBSCRIBED   ← Good
   Realtime subscription status: CHANNEL_ERROR ← Bad (enable Realtime)
   ```

3. **Hard refresh both browsers** (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue 4: "Missing Supabase configuration"
**Symptom**: Can't load any page, immediate error

**Fix**:
1. Check `.env` file exists in project root
2. Verify it contains:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://ijruhconijiksnayqlew.supabase.co"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="eyJ..."
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="eyJ..."
   ```
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

## Expected Console Output

### On Initial Page Load:
```
Subscribing to real-time updates for session: abc123
Realtime subscription status: SUBSCRIBED
✅ Successfully subscribed to real-time updates
📋 Session loaded, checking participant status...
✅ Restored participant from localStorage: SwiftPanda
👥 Initializing presence tracking for: SwiftPanda
```

### When Someone Joins:
```
✅ Session updated via real-time: {id: "abc123", participants: {...}}
```

### When You Vote:
```
✅ Vote submitted: 5
✅ Session updated via real-time: {...}
```

### When Host Reveals:
```
✅ Votes revealed
✅ Session updated via real-time: {...}
```
